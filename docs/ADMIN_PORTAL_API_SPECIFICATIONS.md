### **Frontend Error Handling:**

```javascript
// Global error handler
const handleApiError = (error) => {
  if (error.status === 401) {
    // Redirect to login
    localStorage.removeItem('token');
    window.location.href = '/login';
  } else if (error.status === 403) {
    // Show permission denied message
    showNotification('Access denied', 'error');
  } else if (error.status === 422) {
    // Show validation errors
    displayValidationErrors(error.data.errors);
  } else {
    // Generic error message
    showNotification('Something went wrong', 'error');
  }
};

// Role-based UI rendering
const canEditEmployee = ['SuperAdmin', 'SubCityAdmin'].includes(admin.role);

// Location-based data filtering
const getFilteredData = (data, admin) => {
  if (admin.role === 'SubCityAdmin') {
    return data.filter((item) => item.subcity === admin.subcity);
  } else if (admin.role === 'Admin') {
    return data.filter((item) => item.department === admin.department);
  }
  return data; // SuperAdmin sees all
};
```
