# Deployment Fix - ActivityLog Reference Error

## Issue Description

The application was failing to deploy with Docker Compose and PM2 due to a `ReferenceError: ActivityLog is not defined` error in `models/index.js` at line 66.

## Root Cause

The `models/index.js` file was exporting `ActivityLog` and `SystemSetting` models that don't exist as Sequelize model files in the `models/` directory. While the database tables `activity_logs` and `system_settings` exist in the schema, the corresponding Sequelize model files (`ActivityLog.js` and `SystemSetting.js`) were never created.

## Fix Applied

Removed the undefined model references from the exports in `models/index.js`:

**Before:**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  Admin,
  Employee,
  Complaint,
  Rating,
  Feedback,
  PasswordReset,
  ActivityLog, // ❌ Undefined - causing error
  SystemSetting, // ❌ Undefined - causing error

  // Public models
  PublicComplaint,
  PublicRating,
  PublicFeedback,
  Department,
  Office,
  Sector,
  Division,
  Team,
};
```

**After:**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  Admin,
  Employee,
  Complaint,
  Rating,
  Feedback,
  PasswordReset,

  // Public models
  PublicComplaint,
  PublicRating,
  PublicFeedback,
  Department,
  Office,
  Sector,
  Division,
  Team,
};
```

## Impact Assessment

✅ **Safe Fix**: No application logic was using these models
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All controllers and services continue to work normally
✅ **Database Tables Preserved**: The `activity_logs` and `system_settings` tables remain in the database schema
✅ **Sample Data Scripts**: Continue to work for inserting system settings data

## Verification

- ✅ No controllers import `ActivityLog` or `SystemSetting`
- ✅ No services use these models
- ✅ Database schema and sample data scripts are unaffected
- ✅ All existing functionality remains intact

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Redeploy with Docker Compose

```bash
# Stop existing containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and start
docker-compose up --build -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f office_backend
```

### 2. Verify PM2 Process

```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs office_backend

# Restart if needed
pm2 restart office_backend
```

### 3. Health Check

```bash
# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/employees
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sectors/1/employees
```

## Future Considerations

If you need to implement activity logging or system settings functionality in the future:

### Option 1: Create the Missing Models

```bash
# Create ActivityLog.js model
touch models/ActivityLog.js

# Create SystemSetting.js model
touch models/SystemSetting.js
```

### Option 2: Use Direct Database Queries

Continue using the existing approach with direct SQL queries for these tables, as shown in the sample data scripts.

## New Employee Hierarchy Endpoints

The four new employee hierarchy endpoints are ready and should work correctly after this fix:

- `GET /api/sectors/:sectorId/employees`
- `GET /api/divisions/:divisionId/employees`
- `GET /api/departments/:departmentId/employees`
- `GET /api/teams/:teamId/employees`

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all functionality:

```bash
node test_employee_hierarchy_endpoints.js
```

---

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Application should now deploy successfully with Docker Compose and PM2.
